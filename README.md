A modular, user-friendly website builder that enables authenticated users to create, customize, and manage multi-section pages with live previews. Built with a clean, API-driven Laravel backend and a dynamic Vue 3 single-page frontend, this project showcases thoughtful architectural design and component-driven development.

---

  

## üöÄ Features Implemented

  

### üîê Authentication

- User login using Laravel Sanctum and Vue composition API.

- Authenticated API routes and route guards.

  

### üß± Website Builder Core

- Users can:

- Add/edit/delete pages .

- Add/edit/reorder/remove/live preview sections to a page.

- Supported section types:

	- Header

	- Text

	- HTML

	- Image

  

### üñ•Ô∏è Live Preview

- Real-time preview of page structure as users modify content using Vue reactivity.

  

### üß© Modular & Clean Code

- API: RESTful structure using Laravel Resources & Service Layer.

- Frontend: Vue 3 with Composition API and reusable UI components.

- Fully separated frontend and backend (API-first architecture).

## üß† Key Decisions & Why

-   **Page-Section Relationship:**  
    Modeled a one-to-many relationship where a Page has many Sections. This reflects the real-world concept of a webpage made up of multiple content blocks.
    
-   **Typed Sections Using Enums:**  
    Used an enum to strictly define valid section types (`header`, `text`, `html`, `image`). This enforces data consistency and makes frontend rendering logic simpler.
    
-   **Drag-and-Drop Section Ordering:**  
    Implemented a `position` attribute on sections to track their order. This allows users to reorder sections via drag-and-drop, giving flexible control over page layout.
    
-   **API-First Design:**  
    Designed backend as an API with endpoints to create, update, reorder, and delete pages and sections, enabling smooth frontend interaction and future extensibility.
    
-   **Laravel Sanctum Authentication:**  
    Secured API routes with token-based authentication to protect user data and ensure only authorized users can manage their pages.
    
-   **Vue.js Component-Based UI:**  
    Developed reusable Vue components for each section type, facilitating dynamic rendering and live preview of page content.
    
-   **Test-Driven Approach:**  
    Added unit and feature tests to cover critical workflows including section syncing, ordering, and CRUD operations, ensuring reliability.
    
-   **Clean and Maintainable Code:**  
    Focused on readable code and clear naming conventions to make future enhancements and onboarding easier.
  

### üî® Laravel + Vue SPA (Decoupled)

Opted for a fully decoupled architecture with Vue SPA and Laravel API to allow future scalability (e.g., mobile app, static site generator).

  

### üì¶ Section Type Enum

Used `BenSampo/Laravel-Enum` for strict and validated section types. Enforced valid types during creation and updates.

  

### üß™ API & Unit Tests

Prioritized backend testing for business logic and API endpoints. Used `actingAs()` with Sanctum for authenticated routes.

  

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Clean Architecture

Introduced service classes (e.g., `PageService`) for separation of business logic from controllers, enabling better testability and maintainability.
